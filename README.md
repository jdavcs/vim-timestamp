# Vim Timestamp
A filetype plugin for timestamping .vim files. It does only 2 things: 
* insert a timestamp on demand;
* update a timestamp, on demand or automatically when a .vim file is saved.  

## Installation
[Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
```bash
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/sgolitsynskiy/vim-timestamp.git
```

## Usage
To add a new timestamp, execute the `:TimestampInsert` command.
To update an existing timestamp:
* save the file (`:write` command), or
* execute the `:TimestampUpdate` command

## Optional Configuration
Suggested mappings to add to your .vimrc:
```vim
nnoremap <leader>ti :TimestampInsert<CR>
nnoremap <leader>tu :TimestampUpdate<CR>
```
You may also override the timestamp format by specifyiing these global variables, like so:
```vim
let g:timestamp_prefix = 'Last tinkering: '
let g:timestamp_format = '%Y'
let g:timestamp_regex = '\d\{4\}'
```
Keep in mind that whereas specifying your own prefix (e.g., Last Updated vs. Modified vs. anything else...) is easy, changing the timestamp [format](http://www.manpages.info/linux/strftime.3.html) requires making corresponding edits to the regex variable.

For example, the current format is `%Y %b %d %X %Z` which renders as `" Last Updated: 2001 May 25 06:00:00 AM PDT`
The corresponding regex is: `'\d\{4\} \a\{3\} \d\{2\} \d\{2\}:\d\{2\}:\d\{2\} [AP]M \a\+'` (note the single quotes and the escapes). 
If you wanted to remove the timezone, you would remove `%Z` from your format variable AND the trailing ` \a\+` from your regex variable. 

## Contributions
There are many timestamp scripts that are language-agnostic and provide more options. I want to keep this one simple, lightweight, and specific to .vim files.  
 
Suggestions and feedback are, certainly, [welcome](https://github.com/sgolitsynskiy/vim-timestamp/issues).
